This repository contains code pertaining to our group's analysis of a remarkable
sample of intermediate redshift post-starburst galaxies selected from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey.

Some of the papers by our group analyzing this sample include:
* ["High-Velocity Outflows Without AGN Feedback: Eddington-Limited Star Formation in Compact Massive Galaxies" by A. Diamond-Stanic et al.](http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2368)
* ["Massive Compact Galaxies with High-Velocity Outflows: Morphological Analysis and Constraints on AGN Activity" by P. Sell et al.](http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0677)
* ["Stellar feedback as the origin of an extended molecular outflow in a starburst galaxy" by J. Geach et al.](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1091)
* ["The Discovery of 1000 km/s Outflows in Massive Post-starburst Galaxies at z=0.6" by C. Tremonti et al.](http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0527)
